wordTagShiba

wordTagShiba is a fun memory challenge and match-making game. 
By hovering over the image, you can see which tag the user input. Then if you search for that tag, that image is both highlighted and returned on the right.

It was a proof of concept for a larger project I envisioned for sending more personalized shiba stickers to friends through an online message portal. By typing in "happy" for example, it would send the tagged image associated with "happy".
