This is a Google Add-on I built with html, css, javascript and Googlescript.

It shows you progress bars for how many words you've written overall and how many words you've written in a session.

It asks for access to get data about your google doc so that it can calculate the word count. For more information about how your data is used view the  [privacy policy](http://http://quaiwentt.com/privacy-policy-for-word-count-goal-tracker/)
